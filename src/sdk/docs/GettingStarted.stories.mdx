  The **Symphony Bot Developer Kit** aims to help developers expedite their development
  journey in building production-grade Symphony *Bots* and *Extension Appplications*. The
  kit is made up of a collection of tools that take care of best practices, enabling
  developers to focus their efforts on designing and building workflows and integrations.

  These tools are as follows:
</div>

- **[Command Line Interface](?path=/docs/bot-developer-kit-cli--page)** (CLI): generates
  project scaffolds for *Bot* and *Extension Application* projects, including RSA key
  generation and installing dependencies. *Bot* and *Extension Application* projects
  generated using the CLI are designed to integrate with each other to form complete
  solutions that deliver the best user experience.


- **[Bot SDK](?path=/docs/bot-developer-kit-bot-sdk--page)**: provides baseline best
  practices for handling commands, message templating, Symphony Elements, webhook
  notifications, third-party authentication / REST APIs and many more.


- **[UI Toolkit](?path=/docs/bot-developer-kit-ui-toolkit--page)**: a library of UI
  components for building application views in *Extension Application* projects. These
  components are built with Symphony's design language to fit seamlessly into Symphony and
  are optionally themeable. The library includes many components including layouts,
  buttons, grids, charts and more.
