  The **Symphony Developer Framework** was built to help and guide developers in their integration/development efforts.
  It comprehends a set of tools that are tailored made for organizations that need to integrate Symphony with their existing
  workflows, or to create brand new applications that leverages Symphony's Data Security model. It provides the following:
</div>

- **[CLI](?path=/docs/developer-framework-cli--page)**: allows you to have a functional Bot project up and running in a manner of seconds,
  and to have a complex extension app boilerplate with "themable" capabilities, that already has
  all authentication, bootstrap and symphony integration done for you, and many more.
- **[Bot SDK](?path=/docs/developer-framework-bot-sdk--page)**: provides authentication support, command matchers, Symphony Elements handlers, REST api capabilities, and many more.
  Its foundation is built on top of best development practices and dedicated to Financial related applications.
- **[Toolbox UI](?path=/docs/developer-framework-toolbox-ui--page)**: a library of UI components, that helps you to build complex frontend applications rapidly. It is meant to reduce
    the development of Extension apps from months to weeks. It has from Layout, to forms, and even complex
    financial charts, to allow you get the best out of your workflow, or business requirements.
