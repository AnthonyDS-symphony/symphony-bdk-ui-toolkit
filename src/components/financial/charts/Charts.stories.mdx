# Charts
<hr />

An auto resizable component that renders financial charts. Its based on [react-stockcharts](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts).

## Minimum Requirements

In order to use these components a few adjustments are required. You'll have to add these dependencies
to your project:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "react-stockcharts": "^0.7.8",
    "d3-scale": "^3.2.1",
    "d3-time": "^1.1.0",
    "d3-shape": "^1.3.7",
    "d3-time-format": "^2.2.2",
    ...
}
```

There are Two main Strucutures to follow, **`BaseChart`** which is the component in which you'll build your custom chart
upon, and it wraps a component called **`ChartBuilder`**, These two components have their own properties, and every
property passed to **`BaseChart`** will be propagated to  **`ChartBuilder`**.

It is meant to help you creating charts rapidly with no or very little frictionThese are the charts supported:
  - Area
  - Line
  - Candlestick
  - and many more, that you can find in [the underlying component's docs](https://github.com/rrag/react-stockcharts)
